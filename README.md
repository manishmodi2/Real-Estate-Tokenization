## 🎯 Project Description

Real Estate Tokenization is a revolutionary blockchain-based platform that enables the tokenization of real estate properties as **Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs)** with **fractional ownership capabilities**. This smart contract system allows property owners to convert their real estate assets into digital tokens, enabling investors to purchase fractional shares of properties, thereby democratizing real estate investment and increasing market liquidity.

The platform leverages the **Ethereum blockchain** and **ERC-721 standard** to create unique tokens representing real estate properties, while implementing a sophisticated fractional ownership system that allows multiple investors to own shares of a single property.

## 🌟 Project Vision

## 💡 Usage Examples

### 🏠 Tokenizing a Property

```javascript
// Example: Tokenize a $500,000 property with 1000 shares
await contract.tokenizeProperty(
  "123 Main Street, City, State 12345",
  ethers.utils.parseEther("500"), // $500,000 in ETH equivalent
  1000, // Total shares
  "ipfs://QmYourMetadataHash" // Property metadata URI
);
```

### 💰 Purchasing Shares

```javascript
// Example: Purchase 10 shares of property ID 1
const propertyDetails = await contract.getPropertyDetails(1);
const totalCost = propertyDetails.pricePerShare.mul(10);

await contract.purchaseShares(1, 10, { value: totalCost });
```

### 🔄 Transferring Shares
