# Real Estate Tokenization

## Project Description

Real Estate Tokenization is a revolutionary blockchain-based platform that enables the tokenization of real estate properties as Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) with fractional ownership capabilities. This smart contract system allows property owners to convert their real estate assets into digital tokens, enabling investors to purchase fractional shares of properties, thereby democratizing real estate investment and increasing market liquidity.

The platform leverages the Ethereum blockchain and ERC-721 standard to create unique tokens representing real estate properties, while implementing a sophisticated fractional ownership system that allows multiple investors to own shares of a single property.

## Project Vision

Our vision is to revolutionize the real estate industry by making property investment accessible to everyone, regardless of their financial capabilities. We aim to:

- **Democratize Real Estate Investment**: Break down traditional barriers to real estate investment by enabling fractional ownership
- **Increase Market Liquidity**: Transform illiquid real estate assets into tradeable digital tokens
- **Enhance Transparency**: Utilize blockchain technology to provide transparent and immutable property ownership records
- **Global Accessibility**: Enable worldwide participation in real estate markets without geographical limitations
- **Reduce Transaction Costs**: Eliminate intermediaries and reduce the cost of real estate transactions
- **Create New Investment Opportunities**: Provide new avenues for both property owners and investors to participate in the real estate market

## Usage Examples

### Tokenizing a Property
```javascript
// Example: Tokenize a $500,000 property with 1000 shares
await contract.tokenizeProperty(
  "123 Main Street, City, State 12345",
  ethers.utils.parseEther("500"), // $500,000 in ETH equivalent
  1000, // Total shares
  "ipfs://metadata-uri" // Property metadata URI
);
```

### Purchasing Shares
```javascript
// Example: Purchase 10 shares of property ID 1
const sharePrice = await contract.getPropertyDetails(1);
const totalCost = sharePrice.pricePerShare.mul(10);

await contract.purchaseShares(1, 10, { value: totalCost });
```

### Transferring Shares
```javascript
// Example: Transfer 5 shares to another address
await contract.transferShares(1, recipientAddress, 5);
```
